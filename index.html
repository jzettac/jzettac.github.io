        <h1>Hello, friends of Emma!</h1>
        I've mentioned this to a few of you before -- but this is Emma's girlfriend, Jackie, and I'm writing to invite you to Emma's birthday celebration on Sunday Nov 14! <br>
        We discussed a variety of silly, relatively covid-safe activities and so we'd love for you to join us...<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li><b>at 11:50 am or a little bit earlier on Sunday, November 14 at the corner of Temple and Crown streets in New Haven</b>, for a 2-hour ride on the Elm City Party Bike around New Haven (12 pm - 2 pm but they ask that we arrive a bit early)</li>
            <li>and/or <b>at ~ 4 pm at <a href="https://septemberinbangkok.com/">September in Bangkok</a> for a birthday linner meal</b> (late lunch / early dinner) where we will eat outside on their patio (We'll go from bike to September in Bangkok however makes the most sense)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        I know this is early and stuff, but <b>please let me know if you can make it to the party bike by ~Nov 5, if you can</b>? I'm asking because I'll be keeping an eye on both the weather forecast and the minimum party bike numbers, and if either isn't what we need it to be, I'll edit the invite to be for a slightly different silly/fun/pretty-covid-safe activity. :)<br><br>

        Feel free to call or text me: 734-657-1481<br> or email <code>jczetta@gmail.com</code>

        <h3>Info you might care about:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The party bike is a big and varied "loop" around New Haven neighborhoods on a multi-seat bike that comes with coolers and a driver who guides the bike with a motor. We'll make several stops at local establishments where we can get some food/drink if wanted.  You certainly do not have to drink alcohol (although you can), it's a silly multi-person activity we've never done that we think will be fun...! It does involve actually pedaling, so wear shoes for that; if you don't feel up to pedaling much or at all on the bike that is also totally OK, it'll still be fun. More info: https://elmcitypartybike.com/ </li>
<li>The Party Bike people suggest that if you drive, you park in the Temple St Garage on 182 Crown St. You can get a $4 parking voucher if you want one. Street parking is free in New Haven on Sundays for those coming from afar or who forgot</li>
<li>Assuming we stick to this plan, we'll provide snacks and drinks of various sorts. If you have dietary restrictions that might show up in desserts in particular (nuts, gluten, dairy, eggs, anything else) or really any, please let me know!</li>
<li>If you'd like to bring drinks for yourself or to share, you're welcome to but do not have to, we'll have plenty. The party bike allows beer, wine, cider, seltzer, soda etc, but no hard liquor unless you purchase it for takeout at a restaurant while on the bike "tour".</li>
